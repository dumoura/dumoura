# Eduardo Moura, Ph.D.

### Hi fellow kids ğŸ‘‹

I am driven by the need to connect my research to teaching practice throughout my academic career. I am interested in Decolonial Digital Humanities, Remix Theory, Cultural Analytics, and Media Visualization, focusing on New/Digital Literacies. I have a background in interdisciplinary research in Critical Literacies, Multiliteracies, and New Literacies. Moreover, I have over ten years of experience in teacher training in the Brazilian public education system, which serves the most vulnerable students.
