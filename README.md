### Hi fellow kids ğŸ‘‹

**Eduardo Moura**, Ph.D. -  Applied Linguistics from the Institute of Language Studies at UNICAMP.

I am interested in Decolonial Digital Humanities, Remix Theory, Cultural Analytics, and Media Visualization, focusing on New/Digital Literacies. I have a background in interdisciplinary research in Critical Literacies, Multiliteracies, and New Literacies, and over ten years of experience in teacher training in the Brazilian public education system, which serves the most vulnerable students. I am driven by the need to connect my research to teaching practice throughout my academic career.
